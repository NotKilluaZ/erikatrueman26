  <div class="message" id="welcome">
    Hi Erika! I made this website for you because now that we're no longer able to talk to eachother, I still want to be there for you... Since I won't be able to check up on you or ask if you're okay, I want to care for you in some way anyways. So, whenever you need to hear something depending on what situation you're in, just pick a code from the page I gave you under what applies to you, and a message like this one will appear. Even though I've pre-written each of these messages though, I have put all my love into each of them for you, so don't once think that I don't mean any of these. I mean every single one. Try not to use all of them at once lol, I don't want you to run out of codes. Maybe you won't even use any of them, but at least you have it just in case right? 
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="badDay">
  Bad day? I don't know what happened, but try not to stess too much over it. I know you might feel pretty upset about it right now but don't worry, things will blow over by tomorrow. Just try to unwind yourself for now. Take a hot shower, or a warm bath maybe. I know Nia is always there for you so try talking to her about it if you haven't already. It's just one bad day, remember that. I hope everything turns out alright Erika!
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="badDay1">
  I'm sorry you had a bad day Erika, it must be the worst. But just remember that tomorrow is a new day, and a new beginning, so even though today might feel awful, you'll be suprised to wake up tomorrow and have forgotten any issues that happened today. If you really can't take your mind off of it though, just try to get some rest, relax, or do something you enjoy. If I were you, I would want to pet and play with your cats.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="badDay2">
  You're the strongest person I know Erika. You manage to persevere through the most challenging situations so don't let just one bad day destroy you. If you need anything just ask someone like Charlotte, Nia, or your parents. I know you won't but know that if you want to talk to me about it as well, either just to listen or give advice, I'm also here too. 
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="missMe">
  I miss you too Erika. I miss you everyday, all day. There isn't a single day where you aren't on my mind. Even at night, you still wander my dreams but I wake up to remember you're no longer there anymore. I started taking really long walks at night when I start missing you or overthinking too much, and I stare at the sky hoplessly searching for you, if that even makes sense. So if you're missing me right now, you can probably find me by looking up where we'll be gazing at the same sky.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="missMe1">
  I still miss you too Erika, 24/7. If you need something to help with what you're feeling, you can always look back at the gifts I gave you like re-reading the cards I made for you. If you don't want to be reminded of me more however, you should just know that you'll find someone better anyways. You may miss me now, but soon enough you'll find someone who makes you forget about me.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="missMe2">
  What a coincidence... I miss you too right now. I'm not sure what exactly you miss right now, whether it's the memories, or maybe just talking to me. Either way, feel free to use one of the codes for my favourite memories of us if that's what you miss, or if you just want to tell me about your day or something... well that ones a bit harder since we're in 'no contact.' Speak out your window or into the sky about whatever it is you want to tell me or ask me, and trust that the wind will somehow carry your words to wherever I am so I can listen.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="sleep">
  What's wrong Erika? Why can't you sleep? Is something bothering you? Don't worry, I'm here to listen, even if I can't hear what you're saying. I wish I was there to comfort you and lull you to sleep, but since I can longer do that, just try to imagine I'm there with you. Hug your pillow as hard as you can and imagine it being whoever you need at that moment. Something that I usually do when I can't sleep, is I'll usually hug my pillow and imagine it's you and think about some scenario that I wish I was in until I fall asleep with that thought in my mind. Not sure if that'll help for you but it always works for me. Maybe that's why I always felt so sleepy around you lol, because I was fianlly living my fantasies for real and they made me all sleepy.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="sleep1">
  Is something troubling you again? I know you can't sleep right now but you should really try to get as much as possible. I know you struggle with sleep schedules and all that stuff, but it's important that you get enough rest. An old trick to fall asleep is to look at your ceiling and imagine sheep jumping over a fence. Count the sheep until you fall asleep and don't wake up until everything is okay. Rest until you're ready. 
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="sleep2">
  You should really get some sleep Erika. Even if it's hard, just try your hardest. Disconnect from whatever is keeping you awake, whether it's people, music, something that happened, or whatever. I know you don't sleep much and I hardly ever got to see you sleeping while I wasn't, but I wish you could see how cute and calm you look when you are. My favourite times with you were proabbly when you were sleepy because you turned into such as gentle girl that I was able to love and care for.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="insecure">
  You're so much harder on yourself than anybody else Erika. I know you think you have so many flaws and are insecure about many parts of yourself, but Erika, you are perfect. Seriously. You're biggest enemy is yourself. Even though I know you think I pointed out many of your insecurities, I was just teasing you. I never cared at all about those things you put yourself down for. The only person who really notices the things you're so hard on yourself for is you. I think instead of disagreeing with the compliments people give you because you're insecure about them, you should listen to them and realize that you're so much more perfect than you find yourself.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="insecure1">
  What is it that you're insecure about right now? Is it everything? Or maybe just one specific thing? No matter what, you shouldn't be too hard on yourself for it. If I knew what it was, trust me, I would tell you all the reasons it's perfect on you and why nothing is wrong with it. It's totally okay to feel insecure about parts of yourself, everybody is, but the truth is that the only person who cares about those insecurities the most are themselves. So just remember, nobody even notices the flaws you find in yourself, and even if they do, they won't care anywhere near as much as you do.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="insecure2">
  You are perfect Erika. Even now that I know you're idea of "flaws," I still can't seem to find any in you no matter how hard I may try. I know you automatically just disagree with what I've just said, but try to just accept what I'm saying. Drop the stuborness for just a few minutes and realize what other people think about you without your own delusions. You do not have "so many insecurities it's embarassing," in my eyes, and many other people's as well, you are perfect. I love everything about you Erika..
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="lonely">
  I know how it feels, to be lonely. You can be surrounded by all your friends but still feel so out of place and isolated. I don't really know what to say if you're feeling lonely right now since I also don't know what to do when I feel the same way. I just want someone who understands me, so maybe that's how you feel as well. I wish I could be there with you right now to talk or just to not feel lonely but that's your choice to make right now. Other than offering to be there for you, I don't know if there's anything else I can do. I hope that you find your peace one day Erika, and that you can find contempt being alone or with someone else.

  <div class="message" id="worried">
  It's okay to feel worried about something Erika, but try not to get too worked up over it. If you're worried about something you can't control, there's nothing you can do and you're just going to have to wait for what happens. I know you like to premeditate things and know what's to come, but you can't always know that stuff. Sometimes you just have to have faith in the unknown and try not to stress about what might happen. Just let it happen..
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="mindOff">
  I only have one code for this topic because you're already pretty good at this. If you need to distract yourself, just do what you always do. Go hangout with friends, scroll TikTok, talk with Nia, play with your cats, or even try something new like baking or... maybe try getting your drivers license lol. Don't just do something that will take your mind off of it for a little while though, find something that can take up a long time. Start an art project, or maybe start growing a mini flower garden somewhere. Do something you really want to do, something you'll enjoy.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="suicide">
  Call me. I don't care if you don't want to or if you think you shouldn't. If I don't pick up, call me again. If you call me 5 times and I still haven't answered, walk to my house and knock on my door. Find me some way, anyway. I'm always going to be here for you Erika even if you don't think I am or will. Let me care for you. Please talk to me, tell me everything.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="suicide1">
  Remember our pinky promise.. Don't break a second one or I'll never forgive you again.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="workProblems">
  Trust me, I have bad days at work all the time. The shift probably felt so long and never-ending. I mean, at least it's over now, and next shift will definetly be better. I've never had back-to-back bad work days. I don't know what your place is like but I can always get support from my co-workers. I can always ask for food, or the servers for a drink, or just advice around anything if I need it. Maybe you can do the same. Don't be afraid to let others care for you. The head chef, Josh, told me that one way to show people you care for them is the let them care for you. I hope that maybe one day you'll understand that like I have.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="sick">
  You must feel terrible, I'm sorry Erika. It must suck so much. Just take it easy and stay in bed all day if you have to. Watch movies or just anything you want. If you haven't already, you should try watching Shutter Island, it's one of my favourite movies. Make sure to drink lots of water and take warm baths or showers to relax. Tea and other hot drinks are a really good way to sooth a sore throat if that's what you have too. Especially make sure to get lots of rest. I know how much you like to nap, so take lots of those!
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="sick1">
  If you're sick and need something to eat, try eating soups or other hot foods since they are usually the best at soothing sore throats and fevers. If I'm ever working when you're sick, just ask me to pick you up food from Lulu and I can get it for you. Don't feel bad about it because it's literally free, plus I can basically get as much food as I want anyways. If you need anything else just tell me, I'm always here!
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="overthinking">
  I know how much you like to overthink Erika. I also know that it tears you apart because you get into your own head and thoughts. The best way to overcome this I find is just to find out the truth about whatever it is you're overthinking. Whoever it concerns, just ask them about it and find the answers you're looking for. Even if maybe you don't trust their answers, at least try to listen to them so that you have something. I know you might think that asking is them is bad because it makes you look stupid, or you don't want to cause problems by asking, but all you're doing is creating even bigger problems in your own head than any tiny inconvenience that could arise by asking whoever it concerns. Overthinking is so self-destroying it's crazy.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="overthinking1">
  I overthink alot as well Erika. I know how it feels, but the only thing to stop it is to find out the truth so that your over-complex thoughts are not blidning you. Sometimes all you need is for someone to listen to your overthinking as well to have a clear minded opinion on it. Try venting to someone and they can always give you their advice or outlook on the situation as well. If you need, I'm always here as well, which you probably already know just don't care but that's alright. 
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="overthinking2">
  Go for a walk. A long one. A very very long walk. When you're on your walk, it's okay to think about whatever it is you're overthinking, but start to move away from it and just take in what's around you. Count your steps, stare into the sky and admire the color, or even just focus on your breathing. Calm yourself down, overthinking won't do you anything but stress you out over things that may not at all even be happening. I know it's easier said than done because I do the exact same, but it's all you can really do. I'm always here for you if you need Erika.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="hug">
  You know where I live. You have my number. If you want a hug just ask me, because I'll always enjoy hugging you Erika. <3
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="hug1">
  If you can't reach out to me for a hug, you can always just imagine it. Lay down in your bed and squeeze your pillow if you need. Close your eyes and just imagine where you want to be, and who you want to be with. Heres a virtual hug (turn sideways): (:)\/<
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="comp">
  You already know this, but your eyes are the most beautiful things I've looked at. I could look into them and get lost for hours and never fully understand how someone could have such an amazing, gentle, warming pair of eyes. You literally bless eveything you look at, and anyone who hasn't gotten the chance to realize how pretty they are, is missing out.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="comp1">
  The way you care and love for people is unlike anybody I've ever met. You carry an energy that is so unique that it could very well not be found in anybody else no matter how hard you search. You brighten up every room you enter and attract so many people's attention it's crazy.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="comp2">
  Your hands are so soft. Everytime I got to hold them, my heart melted at the feeling of how silky smooth your skin is. At how soft and gentle your hands are. 
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="comp3">
  I know sometimes you tell yourself that you're just a burden or an inconvenience in everyone's lives, but the reality is that you play such an important role in the lives of everybody you meet. You are so irreplacable by anybody because nobody else could ever be as special and good of a friend as you are to the people around you. You're a one of a kind girl Erika. You are so special and you just don't know it.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="comp4">
  The way you are able to identitfy, help, and handle so many people's problems is incredible. You should be so proud of yourself the way people like me, your parents, and friends already are of you. YOu always give everything you do 100% which is something almost nobody else is able to do. I am so proud of you Erika, for everything you do for others, as well as for starting to care more for yourself as well. You desreve the biggest hug in the world.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="comp5">
  You are enough Erika. Don't ever feel like you aren't enough for anything or anybody. You may have some things that you can always improve on, just as anybody else does, but never feel like you arene't good enough for anything or any person. You are. Everybody is so lucky to have you in their life even if they take it for granted, myself included. I love you so much Erika and I hope one day you'll be able to see yourself the way I see you! <3
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="comp6">
  The way you are able to comfort people is unmatched. Even just by being present to them, you manage to provide warmth and security to whoever you talk to. That's why people come to you for help, because you are the most caring, kind-hearted person we know. Something else to note however, is that you deserve as much love from others as much as you show them. I still wish that one day maybe you'll allow me to do that for you, but either way I hope somebody will show you that love, even if it can't be me who does it...
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="mistake">
  Everybody makes mistakes, it's okay. Everything is going to be just fine, don't worry. Something that may be hard is to frogive yourself, so just try to realize that nothing is forever broken, and everything heals. I don't know what the mistake you made was, but understand that you shouldn't beat yourself up over it because the person who is least likely to forgive you is yourself. It's okay to make mistakes, thats just the process of learning. What's important is that you learn from it and try to better yourself from it, otherwise it's a pointless mistake. That's how I feel right now after our breakup... I made so many mistakes and wasn't able to learn from them until now because of some other reasons, but I've really been able to better myself because of it. It just crushes my heart that you aren't willing to learn and grow alongside me but instead give up and never even consider trying again. But I know I can't ask for more of you because you really did try your hardest and I'm so proud of you for that.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="motive">
  You can achieve anything you want Erika. The only obstacle stopping you is yourself. Even if you think there's something else, there's not. It's just your perception that it is in your way. You really can do anything you set your mind to Erika, and I know that because you are so talented, and hard-working. You have such a great work ethic and it shows because you've been able to become a very respectable person at work and in the minds of your friends. Don't let yourself stop you from doing what you want to accomplish.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="motive1">
  You can do it Erika. If you need support from people in whatever it is you are doing, rely on them for a bit. If you need me, I'll always be there. Do whatever it takes to achieve whatever it is you desire. There is nothing you can't, and don't, deserve.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="bored">
  Things to do: Play video games, watch something, hangout with friends, sleep, talk to someone, call someone, make food, bake, take the c-train somewhere, go shopping, find a new hobby, shop online, take a spa day, do arts & crafts, draw, write about something (feelings, events, thoughts, etc.), or talk to me :)
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="tiredPeople">
  Sometimes you can get fed up with everyone, I get that. when you feel that way, just take a break from everything. Turn off your phone and put it somewhere you can't reach it. I know that even when you say your tired of people, you still hangout with Charlotte and stuff, so maybe just take some time for yourself for even just a day. It's crazy how you're always hanging out with people everyday all day, so once you finally can't do it anymore, just be by yourself for a bit. Take a bath or something and just close your eyes. Do something that is so disconnected from everyone else.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="tiredPeople1">
  Sleep. Just sleep until you're ready to do stuff again. Rest and find yourself. Find that peace you say you want, because the honest truth is, you cannot find that peace with other people. You have to find it alone because that "peace" is just learning to depend on yourself for everything you want from other people like safety or comfort. You need to find it yourself and in my opinion, you'll never find it if you keep surrounding yourself with friends like you do now. Just my thoughts though, take it as you want.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="mad">
  Let it out. Break something, punch something, yell, scream, or just vent it all to Nia or someone else. Don't bottle it up, letting it out always feels better.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="mad1">
  You don't have to of course, but I'm always here to listen. Just call me, text me, or find me in person.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="memory">
  When you first hung out at my house that one night. When I finally told you I liked you. I started to fall asleep and lean on you. It was such a first time feeling that I can never stop remembering. That was the first time I got to enjoy your comfort and feel your soft hands. I was at my happiest that night. I always wonder how you felt during that night, what it was like for you. That was the night I had to sneak you into my house without my parents knowing which made it so much more fun. I'll never forget that night.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="memory1">
  When I took you out for your 16th birthday. I really enjoyed seeing you so happy and being able to give you what you wanted. We went to that park with the lights and then we went back to your house at night. I really felt in love with you that day.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="memory2">
  The night of that party in Jacob's back yard. The one before I told you I liked you. I was really only there that night because I knew you would try to be close to me which to be honest, I wanted. I liked those small moments where our legs were barely rubbing against eachother as if we both didn't notice it and enjoy it the entire time. That sort of stuff happened all the time before we were a thing, and I cherish those moments.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="memory3">
  Our first sleep over at my house. I've never been able to hold someone so close while I slept and I was so happy that night because it felt like I would never lose you. I know there were always small things that I got annoyed at but overall I was always happy that you slept over. I liked being able to hang out with you but not have to drop you off, you could just come into bed with me and stay the night. One of my favourite things in the entire world was falling asleep next to you.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="memory4">
  Snapping you and texting while I was at Jacob's cabin that summer before we were dating. That was when I would check my phone every 2 seconds to see if I had a notification from you. That was when I wanted to tell you every little detail about my day because I wish you were there to experience it with me. Most importantly however, that was when I truly started to catch feelings for you. That was when I started to view you as more than a friend. As someone who I could share my life with.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="memory5">
  Everytime we hung out with people and drove around in their car. We would sit in the back together and be in our own bubble sort of. The part I liked the most though, was when you would get tired, you leaned your body onto me and rested your head on my shoulder. That was the sort of stuff I dreamed about having before 'us' happened.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="noTalk">
  Even though we haven't talked in a while, I still think about you everyday. I wonder what your day has been like, what you've done, who you're with, and how you're feeling everyday. I still care so much about you and don't ever think I've forgotten about you Erika, I haven't. Whenever you do want to talk again, I'll always be open. I know a lot must have changed since the last time we spoke, both for you and myself, so I can't wait to catch up with each other. Maybe when that day comes, we might even want to try again... Maybe? I really hope so.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="hateYou">
  I don't hate you Erika. Even if maybe I do sometimes, I'll never not forgive you for anything. I honestly think I am more forgiving than you because I can basically forget the past and always give second chances. If I ever seem like I hate you, know that I don't hate you, I might just hate that I love you. That I can't get over you. I might just hate the way you treated me and im mad because I still love you. But I'll never hate you Erika, because how can I hate someone who I love like nobody else?
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="cry">
  It's okay to cry. Let it all out. Cry into someone's arms or if you want to be alone, cry into your pillow. Let your tears run until you don't have any left. Nobody is going to judge you for crying, you have every reason to be upset. Just make sure not to stay sad, because even though you find comfort in it, you deserve to find happiness and peace, not sadness. I'm always here for you if you need as well.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="proud">
  I'm so proud of you Erika! You deserve every bit of what you've been able to accomplish, and don't let anyone take that away from you. Cherish this moment and feel good about yourself. Try to find more things to accomplish and feel good about, because that will help you to become more independent and self-reliant I believe. Either way, I'm so glad you got what you wanted and things turned out in your favour, good job!
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="lost">
  You might feel lost right now, but remember that you always have people to support you and find yourself. You might just need to find a balance between when to be alone and when to be around others. If you need anything you can always ask me or your parents, Nia, Charlotte, or other friends. But sometimes feeling lost is just the start of being able to find yourself and that peace you've been wanting. My advice would just to do the things you enjoy and find meaning in that for now. Everything else will come naturally with time, don't worry. Everything will be okay..
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="wish">
  I wish I could have taken you to my cabin some time this summer and spent it alone with you. Just you and me for a weekend and do whatever we wanted. Go to the beach, take a walk, go to the pool, spend a day in bed, everything.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="wish1">
  I wish I got to take you out for a dinner date. Somewhere nice, really nice, like Major Tom or Flores and Pine. I wish I got to spoil you more.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="wish2">
  I wish I could have been there more for you when you were stuggling. I didn't realize the severity of it until now and I just wish I could have been there for you. If we ever became something again, I would never let myself repeat how I treated you.
  </div>
  <div class="message" id="wish3">
  I wish I got to see you fall asleep in my arms more. I often fantasize you falling asleep next to me where I get to tuck you into bed and watch you sleep so peacfully.
  </div>

  <div class="message" id="loveYou">
  You make my heart melt everytime I think of you. My heart skips a beat when I look and you, and skips another when you look back at me. I will never understand how someone like you could be so perfect. I love you Erika, so much.
